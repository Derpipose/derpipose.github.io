        <h1>This is the work in progress code that I am working on.</h1>
        <h1>Welcome to the Moon!</h1>
        <p>The moon is a strange place to find yourself. It deprives you of all memories and strips you down to the bare essentials. Sometimes you get companions, other times, you are left to fend for yourself. Time is irrelevent here and you could find yourself interacting with people far in the past or future, at least from the perspective you are from.</p>

        <h1>What races are avaliable?</h1>
        <p>Almost any fantasy race in Tree's setting is up for grabs. If you want to play a boring human, you can. Or you can spice things up with beastmen, elves, or even a dwarf. The only ones that are off limits are kobolds and strathund. Spoiler alert, you will be fighting these guys at some point in time. No need for a poor little memoryless creature to fight others of its kin.</p>

        <h1>What classes are avaliable?</h1>
        <p>Any standard class in Tree's settings are up for grabs but note that any class that uses diplomacy skills, will likely be neigh useless as... Spoiler alert, there is no one to be diplomatic with. Your best bet would be either a combat or magic class. Although magic books may be difficult to find, you can encounter them in the dungeons.</p>

        <h1>What kind of combat will we be looking at?</h1>
        <p>The kind of combat you will be looking at depends on the mood that Tree is in in that particular day. Some days he may make you fight an aquatic battle, others, a tree fight where the tree ents fight us. </p>

        <h1>Do I need to have previous experience to join the campaign?</h1>
        <p>Previous experience is always nice but never needed. If you have never played in a campaign of Tree's, don't worry, you always have one veteran player that is willing to help you. Tree's wife, Riley, is in each campaign and is more than happy to help new players learn. She will help you learn the combat system, how the magic works and any nuances that are associated with the campaigns.</p>

        <h1>Is there any requirements to get into the campaign?</h1>
        <p>Nope. Just a willingness to roleplay a heck ton and prepare for the most random style campaign that Tree can throw at you.</p>
