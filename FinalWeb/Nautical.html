        <h1>This is the work in progress code that I am working on.</h1>
        <h1>Welcome to Nautical!</h1>
        <p>Prepare yourself for oceanic fun, shanties and a slew of cursing sailors, you're bound for the high waters! The Nautical setting is a setting taking place on a ship of sorts. You and your crew will be tasked with taking out any wyvern you come across and need to know only the barest amount of life aboard a ship. </p>

        <h1>What races are avaliable?</h1>
        <p>Any of Tree's fantasy races are avaliable for you to play. If you want to play a boring human, you can. Or you can spice things up with beastmen, elves, or even a dwarf.</p>

        <h1>What classes are avaliable?</h1>
        <p>Any standard class in Tree's settings are up for grabs. The only addition that should be mentioned here that aren't yet in the classes document is .</p>

        <h1>What kind of combat will we be looking at?</h1>
        <p></p>

        <h1>Do I need to have previous experience to join the campaign?</h1>
        <p>Previous experience is always nice but never needed. If you have never played in a campaign of Tree's, don't worry, you always have one veteran player that is willing to help you. Tree's wife, Riley, is in each campaign and is more than happy to help new players learn. She will help you learn the combat system, how the magic works and any nuances that are associated with the campaigns.</p>

        <h1>Is there any requirements to get into the campaign?</h1>
        <p></p>
