        <h1>This is the work in progress code that I am working on.</h1>
        <h1>Welcome to Hylian!</h1>
        <p>The hylian setting, one of the most fatastical settings you could ever get your silly little butt into.</p>

        <h1>What races are avaliable?</h1>
        <p>Any fantasy race in Tree's setting is up for grabs. If you want to play a boring human, you can. Or you can spice things up with beastmen, elves, or even a dwarf.</p>

        <h1>What classes are avaliable?</h1>
        <p>Any standard class in Tree's settings are up for grabs but note that any class that uses diplomacy skills, will likely be neigh useless as... Spoiler alert, there is no one to be diplomatic with. Your best bet would be either a combat or magic class. Though, even the magic classes will suffer in this land as mana potions and magic books will be hard pressed to find.</p>

        <h1>What kind of combat will we be looking at?</h1>
        <p>If you have played any Legend of Zelda game, you already know some of the enemies you can encounter. If you have played Breath of the Wild, you know most of the enemies and their fighting styles. Along the coast, you are liable to see more wind waker enemies. Further inland towards the Great Plateau you might encounter more Breath of the Wild enemies. Either way, you are in for a surprise either way.</p>

        <h1>Do I need to have previous experience to join the campaign?</h1>
        <p>Previous experience is always nice but never needed. If you have never played in a campaign of Tree's, don't worry, you always have one veteran player that is willing to help you. Tree's wife, Riley, is in each campaign and is more than happy to help new players learn. She will help you learn the combat system, how the magic works and any nuances that are associated with the campaigns.</p>

        <h1>Is there any requirements to get into the campaign?</h1>
        <p>Yes, you must have played and beaten one LoZ game. It will help you to understand what is going on in the setting. </p>
